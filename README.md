## LibDriver BME280

[![MISRA](https://img.shields.io/badge/misra-compliant-brightgreen.svg)](/misra/README.md) [![API](https://img.shields.io/badge/api-reference-blue.svg)](https://www.libdriver.com/docs/bme280/index.html) [![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-brightgreen.svg)](/LICENSE)

The BME280 is a humidity sensor especially developed for mobile applications and wearables where size and low power consumption are key design parameters. The unit combines high linearity and high accuracy sensors and is perfectly feasible for low current consumption, long-term stability and high EMC robustness. The humidity sensor offers an extremely fast response time and therefore supports performance requirements for emerging applications such as context awareness, and high accuracy over a wide temperature range.

LibDriver BME280 is a full-featured driver for BME280, launched by LibDriver.It provides continuous reading, single reading and additional features. LibDriver is MISRA compliant.

### Instruction

/src includes LibDriver BME280 source files.

/interface includes LibDriver BME280 IIC, SPI platform independent template.

/test includes LibDriver BME280 driver test code and this code can test the chip necessary function simply.

/example includes LibDriver BME280 sample code.

/doc includes LibDriver BME280 offline document.

/datasheet includes BME280 datasheet.

/project includes the common Linux and MCU development board sample code. All projects use the shell script to debug the driver and the detail instruction can be found in each project's README.md.

/misra includes the LibDriver MISRA code scanning results.

### Install

Reference /interface IIC, SPI platform independent template and finish your platform IIC, SPI driver.

Add the /src directory, the interface driver for your platform, and your own drivers to your project, if you want to use the default example drivers, add the /example directory to your project.

### Usage

You can refer to the examples in the /example directory to complete your own driver. If you want to use the default programming examples, here's how to use them.

#### example basic

```C
#include "driver_bme280_basic.h"

uint8_t res;
uint32_t i;
float temperature_c;
float pressure_pa;
float humidity_percentage;

/* basic init */
res = bme280_basic_init(BME280_INTERFACE_IIC, BME280_ADDRESS_ADO_LOW);
if (res != 0)
{
    return 1;
}

...
    
/* loop */
for (i = 0; i < 3; i++)
{
    /* delay 1000ms */
    bme280_interface_delay_ms(1000);

    /* read data */
    res = bme280_basic_read((float *)&temperature_c, (float *)&pressure_pa, (float *)&humidity_percentage);
    if (res != 0)
    {
        (void)bme280_basic_deinit();

        return 1;
    }

    /* output */
    bme280_interface_debug_print("bme280: %d/%d.\n", i + 1, 3);
    bme280_interface_debug_print("bme280: temperature is %0.2fC.\n", temperature_c);
    bme280_interface_debug_print("bme280: pressure is %0.2fPa.\n", pressure_pa);
    bme280_interface_debug_print("bme280: humidity is %0.2f%%.\n", humidity_percentage);
    
    ...
}

...
    
/* deinit */
(void)bme280_basic_deinit();

return 0;
```

#### example shot

```C
#include "driver_bme280_shot.h"

uint8_t res;
uint32_t i;
float temperature_c;
float pressure_pa;
float humidity_percentage;

/* shot init */
res = bme280_shot_init(BME280_INTERFACE_IIC, BME280_ADDRESS_ADO_LOW);
if (res != 0)
{
    return 1;
}

...
    
/* loop */
for (i = 0; i < 3; i++)
{
    /* delay 1000ms */
    bme280_interface_delay_ms(1000);

    /* read data */
    res = bme280_shot_read((float *)&temperature_c, (float *)&pressure_pa, (float *)&humidity_percentage);
    if (res != 0)
    {
        (void)bme280_shot_deinit();

        return 1;
    }

    /* output */
    bme280_interface_debug_print("bme280: %d/%d.\n", i + 1, 3);
    bme280_interface_debug_print("bme280: temperature is %0.2fC.\n", temperature_c);
    bme280_interface_debug_print("bme280: pressure is %0.2fPa.\n", pressure_pa);
    bme280_interface_debug_print("bme280: humidity is %0.2f%%.\n", humidity_percentage);
    
    ...
}

...
    
/* deinit */
(void)bme280_shot_deinit();

return 0;
```
